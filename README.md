# 3DEngine
Developed a 3D engine entirely from scratch using only Python and the TkInter module.
Make sure you have TkInter installed.
To run a demo, run Main.py

To rotate the camera, either use the arrow keys, or right click and drag the mouse.
To move the camera, use WASD.
To pause/play mesh rotations, press k.

# Motivation
This summer, I wanted to create a game in Unreal Engine 4. However, the more I used the engine, the more I grew curious on how the engine functioned. As such, I set out to build my own 3D engine from scratch using the basic Python graphics module "TkInter". This project taught me the basics of 3D engines: Nodes, Meshes, Transforms, Shaders, Culling, W-Index Sorting, and related Linear Algebra.
